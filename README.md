# Coding Blocks Blog

This is a Jekyll blog. To maintain the blog, it's best you have Ruby installed.
From within Ruby, install Jekyll and Rake too.

```shell
gem install jekyll
gem install rake
```


## Creating New Articles

There is a rake task for this -

```
rake new_post["Topic of new post"]
```

## Creating a new page

There is a rake task for this as well -

```
rake new_page["Title of Page"]
```
Set `page.sitemap.include` to `'yes'`, to include the page in sitemap.
```
sitemap:
  include: 'yes'
```
