At Coding Blocks, over more than 3 years now, we have been hard at work, striving to create the best possible journey into the world of programming for thousands of aspiring software developers. 
In these years, we have had the fortune of having close to 10,000 budding programmers come and learn a variety of skills including **Data Structures and Algorithms**, **Mobile App Developement**, **Web Backend and Frontend Development**, and more recently, **Game Development** and **Machine Learning**. 

As more days go by, and we interact with more and more of our students (most of whom are undergraduate engineering students), we get to know better the requirements, better approaches, and how better to package this journey.

Building on top of most of our learnings of the past year, and taking feedback from numerous former Coding Blocks students, and also experts from the software industry, we tweaked around some of our programmes, and are launching some entirely new programmes. 

I am really pleased to announce the following new programmes being launched from December, 2017 at _**Coding Blocks**_ 

## [Certified Python Developer Programme](https://cb.lk/courses/python1) -

We, for long, had two programmes for beginners to start with programming - one using C++ and another using Java. While it is a good idea to learn programming using one of those two languages, Python is among the most popular languages, and is seeing an increasing number of applications in cutting edge fields like Machine Learning and Data Science. Keeping that in mind, we are starting a Certification programme in Python, that is suitable for people who have very little prior programming experience. 

The programme has been divided into 4 modules:

1. Basics of Python

- Why Python?
- Basic syntax and data containers
- Object oriented programming

2. Intermediate Python

- Overview of common python modules and some advanced functions
- Working with files (txt/pdf/csv/xml/zip/json)
- CLI programming using Python
- Desktop GUI development using Python
- Multithreading and multiprocessing in Python


3. Python for web

- Consuming APIs
- Web scraping and crawling
- Web automation using Selenium

4. Chatbot development using Python

- Creating a messenger chatbot using Python
- Adding intelligence to bots using api.ai
- Storing and accessing data using MongoDB
- Heroku deployment

This programme will be conducted by _**Nikhil**_, who is famous on the internet by the name of _**IndianPythonista**_, and has a well known [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/IndianPythonista) and [Blog](https://indianpythonista.wordpress.com/)

Since the inception of Coding Blocks, the two oldest courses we have been running are **Launchpad** (Programming Fundamentals in C++) and **CRUX** (Programming Fundamentals in Java).
These two are our _flagship_ courses, so to speak, attracting the maximum number of students, and also being the best reviewed.

Both these courses would start from "How to write a program" level topics, for someone who has **zero** programming knowledge, and than extends into advanced Data Structures like *Graphs*, *Segment Trees*, *Tries*, and algorithms like Djikstra's or A* Search. 

The spectrum is quite wide, and many students have expressed the difficulty involved with a learning curve that rapidly goes from gradual to steep. Also, we have been realising that there are many out there who want to just learn the concept and syntax of a language first, and not rush into Data Structures and Algorithms right away, and rather consider that some time later. 

To address the demand of only basics of programming language, and not letting the learning curve turn too steep, we are introducing two new _basic proficiency_ certification programmes, that is amied at people who have **no prior experience at all** with programming. It will take you through the motions of thinking like a computer, building algorithms and flowcharts in your mind, (which you have to do before you write any code), develop problem solving skills and make you well versed with the basic syntax of the programming language. We are launching the _**Basic Proficiency Certification**_ programme in both C++ and Java languages. 

## [C++ Basic Proficiency Certification](https://cb.lk/courses/cpp101) -  
 - Thinking like a computer, algorithms, flowcharts
 - C++ complete language syntax
 - Datatypes and variables
 - Loops and conditional statements
 - Pointers, references and values
 - Functions
 - Arrays, Strings and 2-dimensional arrays (matrices)
 - Time complexity of algorithms
 - Introduction to Recursion

| No of. Lectures 	| Course Fees 	| Duration 	|
|-----------------	|-------------	|----------	|
| 10              	| Rs. 8,000   	| 4 weeks  	|  



## [Java Basic Proficiency Certification](https://cb.lk/courses/java101) -
 - Thinking like a computer, algorithms, flowcharts
 - Java complete language syntax
 - Datatypes and variables
 - Loops and conditional statements
 - Functions
 - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
 - Arrays, Strings and 2-dimensional arrays (matrices)
 - Time complexity of algorithms
 - Introduction to Recursion

| No of. Lectures 	| Course Fees 	| Duration 	|
|-----------------	|-------------	|----------	|
| 10              	| Rs. 8,000   	| 4 weeks  	|

Many of the graduates of our _**CRUX**_ (Programming Fundamentals in Java) program had been expressing their desire to learn to build desktop apps and servers using Java. 
Keeping those demands in mind, we are also having a 8-day bootcamp at our Dwarka Centre this December on _**Java Apps**_ that will cover both desktop apps in Java and Java Web Servers.  

  - Java Language Syntax and OOP revision
  - Multithreading in Java
  - Introduction to Gradle
  - Desktop Apps using JavaFX
  - Java Web Servers with Spring Boot
  - Building REST APIs with Spring Boot
  - SQL Databases using JDBC and Hibernate 

| No of. Lectures 	| Course Fees 	| Duration 	|
|-----------------	|-------------	|----------	|
| 8              	  | Rs. 6,000   	| 2 weeks  	| 

This programme will be conducted by _**Anuj Garg**_, who has been a GSOC mentor and is now a Google Code-in org-admin for JBOSS.
